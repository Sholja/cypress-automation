# cypress-automation-setup

## Setting up:

- Install dependencies:
  `yarn install`

- Start tests in regular mode
  `yarn test`

- Start tests in silent mode (browser will not open, tests will run in the background)
  `yarn test:silent`

## Notes:

- Use Visual Studio Code and install following extensions:
  [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

- Always try to move everything to constants. If something is changed in the future, you just change it in constants and that is it.

# Happy testing!!!
